                Settling in the new world is a choice you’ll never regret! There’s beautiful scenery, bountiful resources, fertile land, and an advantageous geography. Who wouldn’t want to settle here?

                These lands are sprawling, with many hills, forests, and rivers stretching as far as the eye can see. The inland mountains stand far above sea level. There are plenty of open spaces at the foothills for farming crops and ranching. In addition, vast spaces on the shoreline are perfect for building cities and ports, with protection from the mountains on the mainland that can prevent land invasions from other countries. And the temperate climate, with almost year-round sun and a comfortable temperature, makes this place ideal. </p

				The seas are so filled with fish that you’ll no longer need to import fish anymore. You may even find pearls when eating a local delicacy of mussels. Many of the seaports bear a vast amount of resources. Flowers that can be converted into red dye are everywhere. Not only that, there are plenty of spices along with cotton, rhubarb, and many berries from trees and bushes. These are also found in Europe, but they are in much greater abundance here. And of course, this place is in no way lacking metals: silver and gold can be found in rivers and mines with little effort. The trees bear fruits of all kinds, some of which you can’t find anywhere else in the world. The wood is strong and sturdy and is suitable for building boats and houses. And the grapes here make a great wine unlike anything you’ll have ever tasted.
