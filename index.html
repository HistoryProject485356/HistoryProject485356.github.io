                If you settle in these areas in the new world, you will not regret it. There’s beautiful scenery, bountiful resources, fertile land, and an advantageous geography. Who wouldn’t want to settle here?

                TThe seas are so filled with fish that you’ll no longer need to import fish anymore. You may even find pearls when eating a local delicacy of mussels. 
                Many of the seaports bear a vast amount of resources. 
                Not only that, there are plenty of spices along with cotton, rhubarb, and cinnamon. 
                There is also an abundance of metals like silver that can be found in rivers and mines with little effort. 
                The trees bear fruits of all kinds, some of which you can’t find anywhere else in the world. 
                The wood itself is strong and sturdy, and would be suitable for building a boat or similar.  
                There are many berries that come from the trees and bushes that are also found in Europe, but they are much more plentiful here. 
                There are grapes here that make great wine unlike anything you’ve ever tasted.

                These lands are sprawling, with many hills, forests, and rivers as far as the eye can see.
                The inland mountains stretch far above sea level.
                There are plenty of open spaces at the foothills for farming crops and for ranching.
                In addition, vast spaces on the shoreline would be great places to build cities and ports, and the mountains on the mainland can prevent a land invasion from other countries.
                The climate is temperate, with almost year-round sun and a comfortable temperature.
